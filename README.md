# Plant Disease Detection

This project focuses on detecting plant diseases using deep learning techniques implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
- Image-based plant disease classification
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation
- Model training and evaluation

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled images of various plant species affected by different diseases.
- It includes healthy and diseased samples for classification.
- Images are preprocessed using techniques such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- The dataset is sourced from publicly available repositories or collected manually.

## Machine Learning Techniques
- Utilizes Vision Transformer for feature extraction and classification.
- Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied.
- Uses transfer learning with pre-trained models like ResNet, or MobileNet.
- Implements performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
- Upload plant images to be classified
- Run the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance
- View predictions for sample images

## Results
- Displays accuracy and loss graphs
- Predicts plant diseases from test images
